        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>I have worked for the American Red Cross Blood services for 24 years. I started as a mobile
            phlebotomist, I was promoted to an apheresis operator in 2002. I have been in a supervisor role for 17
            years, also functioning as a trainer. Currently, I manage a team of 15 at the Lehi Blood center location. I
            have seen the organization go through many changes and been part of implementing those changes, we went from
            doing everything on paper and carrying around binders full of documents to implementing new modern processes
            into all of our functions, we have implemented new apps, computer systems and just recently upgraded to
            salesforce. I have been a champion of change and supported my team through changes. I have worked with
            cross-functional teams to improve processes. I have collaberated with other departments to streamline
            operations and improve collection outcomes. I have been able to lead projects including moving our entire
            blood collection
            center from the old location in Orem to the new modern location in Lehi. I have been able to lead my team
            to meet and exceed goals while constantly growing and adapting to the ever changing blood collection
            business. I implemented COVID protocols practically overnight during a time of crisis and was able to guide
            my team through that challenging time. During my time at this organization I have attended numerous
            leadership workshops and skill building sessions. I attended an 8 hour crucial conversations training, as
            well as an Inside Out coaching training.
